--accent-pink: #f0bc00; A vibrant pink that adds a playful pop of color.
--neutral-grey: #938c8c; A muted grey for balanced typography and subtle accents.
Secondary colors used sparingly across the website to enhance the visual experience include:

### Database Schema

The database schemas were designed using [Lucid App](https://lucid.app/). These schemas were pivotal in planning the database models and defining their respective fields. They also facilitated visualizing the relationships between the models and their interactions. 



<!-- ## UX

## Agile Development
The project applied Agile Methodology on GitHub for planning and execution. User Stories were established as GitHub issues clearly outlining their purposes.

Additionally, 5 Epics were initiated and expanded into ? User Stories. Each of these stories was also assigned story points based on their complexity. The specifics of each epic, along with their corresponding user stories, can be located within the project's kanban board
[here](https://github.com/users/nataliatesarova/projects/17/views/1). -->

<!-- ## Epics and user stories

The following Epic and user stories were completed. The MoSCoW prioritization was used to categorize the user story tasks into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. Must Haves are critical, Should Haves are important, Could Haves are desirable, and Won't Haves are excluded for now. This categorization helps focus on crucial tasks first, ensuring project success while allowing flexibility for less critical items.

## Search Engine Optimization SEO and Marketing

### Business Model

Hot&Cup embraces a consumer-centric online retail approach, delivering a range of quality teas, coffees, and hot chocolate. Catering to connoisseurs of these beverages, our platform ensures a smooth and intuitive shopping journey. The goal is to attract customers desiring variety, value for money, and the convenience of having their favorite items delivered to their homes.

### SEO

Sitemap and robots.txt files have been added to the site's root to help with SEO.

A sitemap, crucial for website navigation, was developed with the assistance of xml-sitemaps based on the live version of the site, and has been positioned at the top directory of the project. Furthermore, a robots.txt document has been instituted at the project's highest level to direct search engine bots regarding which website URLs are permissible for access.

### Marketing

From a marketing perspective, the website features a section for newsletter subscription, aimed at boosting user interaction and advancing the online store's visibility through strategic email marketing campaigns and a robust social media presence.

Additionally, a Facebook page has been established to further enhance our digital footprint and engage with our audience on social media platforms.
